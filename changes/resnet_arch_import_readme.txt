Resnet implemented 
All works fine 
Seems to be an issue importing the functions identity_block and conv_block from resnet50.py - little weird as Resnet50 function can be easily imported from it.

However, when the file checked to see the functions present in it, identity_block and conv_block do not pop up. Maybe github resnet50.py and resnet50.py available as the keras package on colabs are not consistent.

Spent too much time - not much use
Discarded for better usage of time.
